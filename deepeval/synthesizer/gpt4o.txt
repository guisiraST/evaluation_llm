Just as everyone thinks GPT-4 is already a game changer, OpenAI surprises AI fans and experts with yet another revolutionary AI tool – GPT-4o.

Enthusiasts call it the emotive bot, capable of harnessing data from multiple sources to create compelling outputs.

If you’re into AI video creation, you will be as excited as we are at Puppetry.

But what is this new technology? How different is it from previous versions?

Keep reading! This article will introduce you to the new and exciting world of GPT-4o.

What Is GPT-4o?

Some believe the “o” in GPT-4o describes the technology’s omniscient nature.

Although quite true, the “o” reflects GPT-4o’s Omni status or “all.”

GPT-4o unifies text, voice, and visual information to create a more engaging experience.

We must reiterate that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 focused more on typed text-based interactions.

Users need a keyboard to input prompts and interact with OpenAI’s generative AI technology.

Hence, we can expect GPT-4o to revolutionize every aspect of content generation, video production, data analysis, and other functions made more convenient and efficient by artificial intelligence.

Here’s a guide on how to use ChatGPT for Puppetry.

How Different Is GPT-4o from Previous GPTs?

Gauging GPT-4o’s impact on the AI-crazed world isn’t easy.

After all, the new technology is only days old.

So, what makes everyone so upbeat about GPT-4o? Let’s look at the innovations this technology offers.

ChatGPT conversations go keyboard-less
Voice conversations go real-time with GPT-4o.

Previous iterations require a keyboard (physical or virtual) to type prompts and interact with OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot. No more!

OpenAI revolutionized its GPT tool to respond to voices. You can talk usually, and ChatGPT replies accordingly.

Speak in a friendly voice, and GPT-4o will do likewise.

Change your tone a bit, and ChatGPT adjusts.

Here’s the best part!

You can interrupt GPT-4o anytime during real-time voice conversations.

For example, in the first part, you talk like Morgan Freeman and change your voice to mimic C3PO.

GPT-4o corrects itself to make the conversation more relevant and within context.

GPt-4o is so intelligent it can even create human-like responses. For example, it will apologize for missing crucial information in its output. Now that’s cool!

It can answer questions about screenshots and photos
Many AI video creators and AI tools have multi-language support.

Unfortunately, some ideas are better expressed as images. After all, words aren’t always sufficient in many cases.

Imagine watching cricket for the first time, and you don’t know how the game works.

Just ask GPT-4o-enabled ChatGPT. It will explain everything in detail, even without typing the prompt.

You can do the same with pictures. For instance, if you come across a product and want to know its brand and qualities, ask GPT-4o.

Here’s the kicker!

GPT-4o works across 50 languages, and its API is 200% faster than the previous version’s Turbo mode.

Imagine how AI avatars, puppets, animations, and talking heads will seem more credible to your viewers regardless of their language.

Creating AI art is more fun.


Here’s where Puppetry users (and other AI video makers and image creators) can appreciate GPT-4o’s awesome powers.

The technology extends AI art possibilities to areas where GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 failed miserably.

You can create more stunning images with highly readable text.

GPT-4o can also arrange the text more creatively.

For instance, you could produce an AI-generated image like typewriter pages. And if you fancy the silver screen, a movie poster should be handy.

Experts say GPT-4o can also emulate handwriting and add doodles to page margins, which should excite content creators.

No more web-only ChatGPT
Nothing is wrong with a web-only app like ChatGPT. However, some folks prefer a dedicated platform to install on desktop computers. GPT-4o addresses this need.

ChatGPT Plus subscribers can install the GPT-4o-powered ChatGPT on their Apple Macs to enjoy screenshot and keyboard shortcut support.

Unfortunately, this desktop computer-based GPT will only be available to Windows users by the end of the year.

Interacting with GPT-4o will no longer require web access. You can create AI images, avatars, videos, and other content on your desktop computer.

ANYONE and EVERYONE can leverage most of GPT-4o’s robust features
Here’s the most significant advantage of GPT-4o over previous iterations.

ChatGPT is available in three versions or tiers, with the two upper levels costing $20 (ChatGPT Plus) to $30 (ChatGPT Team) monthly.

The highly emotive GPT-4o is available even to free ChatGPT users.

Unfortunately, the prompts are limited, and they won’t enjoy the technology’s real-time voice conversations.

Exceeding the prompt limits will revert the system to GPT-3.5.

Other Questions You Like to Ask
When is GPT-4o available?
OpenAI launched GPT-4o on May 13, 2024, and is now available to all ChatGPT users, including Free, Plus, and Team.

However, limitations exist across tiers. By June's end, industry experts and enthusiasts are upbeat about additional enterprise features.

What’s the difference between free ChatGPT and paid versions?
Although GPT-4o is available for all ChatGPT users, including the free version, only ChatGPT Team and Plus users can enjoy the new technology’s robust features.

For example, free ChatGPT users have limited GPT-40-powered prompts, while Team and Plus subscribers can enjoy up to five times more prompts before the system whittles down to GPT-3.5.

Moreover, only ChatGPT Plus subscribers can enjoy GPT-4o’s voice functions.

Is GPT-4o available on other AI tools besides ChatGPT?
OpenAi says GPT-4o is only available on ChatGPT.

However, experts foresee other AI platforms (e.g., Microsoft’s CoPilot) adopting the latest technology.

Although OpenAI makes GPT-4o available to anyone on its GPT Store, the company remains cautious about third-party abuse. Hence, it’s working only with trusted partners.



Conclusion
We can understand why many marketers, data analysts, content creators, businesses, and virtually any AI fan are upbeat about OpenAI’s latest offering.

GPT-4o brings us closer to a virtual world we only knew existed in fiction.

Everything is getting real, changing our world more positively than anyone can imagine.
